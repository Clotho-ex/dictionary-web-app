## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - State Management
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) - Open Source Icon Library

### What I learned

Zustand allows state to be maintained by one true source and removes messy props drilling and has less boilerplate code. With one store, I was able to handle empty input field case, make a call to the API, and handle possible errors with ease. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://medium.com/@tilakOli/a-short-guide-to-accessibility-in-reactjs-and-the-importance-of-aria-for-accessibility-7278139930e9) - This helped me with ARIA labels. I was looking for in what case to use which labels and it helped me a lot.
